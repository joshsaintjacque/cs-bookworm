A curated list of great books for anyone who wants to be a better programmer.

## Contributing
If you know of any programming books that this list is missing please feel free to create a PR. Please follow the existing convention and formatting, unless you're opening a PR to change the formatting itself.

Submissions should be generally well-rated and current. Timeless books are fine and encourages (e.g., Code Complete) but old versioned books are not (e.g., Rails Recipes Rails 3 Edition).

## Programming Practices
This sections includes books which are about general programming best practices and design. Examples might be in one particular language or pseudolanguage, but the concepts are designed to work across languages.
